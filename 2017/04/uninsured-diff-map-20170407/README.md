# Uninsured rate differences

This graphic has two "modes," specified in the [project spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VRFQpQge3gwV9MNjqbT3_BcozY3y8oe_B1ZIWwpEfSU/edit#gid=0):

* **dynamic:** The development version. The maps shown are drawn using D3 based on data pulled from the copy spreadsheet. These maps render SUPER-SLOWLY. **DO NOT PUBLISH FROM THIS MODE.** To update the production-ready flat maps, load the dynamic version, take screenshots, and save over the flat PNGs. Then flip the `graphic_mode` to `flat`.

* **flat:** The final version for deployment/publication. The maps shown are PNGs.
