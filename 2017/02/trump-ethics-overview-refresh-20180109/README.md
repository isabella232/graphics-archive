# Trump Ethics Monitor overview graphic

This is a refresh of our earlier graphic offering an overview of the 10 promises covered in the Trump Ethics Monitor.

## Updating the text

Since the overview graphic pulls from the same data spreadsheet as the
full Ethics Monitor itself, the text in this graphic is distributed
across a few places in the spreadsheet. Here's where it all lives:

### Headline and intro

This is the text at the top of the graphic (currently "In early 2017, we
identified..." and "None of them shows..."). It can be found on the
[labels worksheet in the graphic spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ZCt6EgcQCIoN8BaHqVvajgCyOyNl5cqvob3hHZqyho/edit#gid=0).

### Category labels

These are the three blurbs that define our categories of promises. They
can be found in the [overview_data worksheet in the graphic
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ZCt6EgcQCIoN8BaHqVvajgCyOyNl5cqvob3hHZqyho/edit#gid=1682965493).

The two other columns in that worksheet should not be changed unless
there are data updates. The `category` column is used to match up the
categories with the individual promises, and they are used to add CSS
classes to determine color and placement. The `count` column indicates
the number of promises in each category.

### Promise titles

These are the titles for each promise that appear when a promise number
is tapped or moused over. They can be found in the [data worksheet in the graphic spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ZCt6EgcQCIoN8BaHqVvajgCyOyNl5cqvob3hHZqyho/edit#gid=1401251923).

The graphic also uses the `slug` field in the same worksheet to set the
anchor destinations for the navigation.
