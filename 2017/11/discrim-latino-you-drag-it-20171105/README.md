"You Drag It" Chart Prototype
=============================

Prototype for an interactive bar chart form that allows the user to select a value for a bar and then be shown the actual value.

This is being developed for charts that are part of the "You, Me, Them" series based on the Discrimination in America polling done with Harvard.
