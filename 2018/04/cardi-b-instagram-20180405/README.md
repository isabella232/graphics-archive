# NPR-di B: Bartier Chart-i

Hello! Maybe you've come here because someone has asked you to make a
similar chart with cut-out faces on it. Maybe the story it's for is
totally boring and nothing is gained by adding cut-out faces. Here's a
little rationale for why we took this approach for the Cardi B story.

This story is a bit of an outlier, as it's a feature story about a very
visual and dynamic personality. Since Music doesn't feature charts very
frequently, we sometimes feel comfortable taking more creative liberties
with our graphics. For this specific chart, it seemed completely
appropriate: Cardi's style is a major part of her public personality,
and she changes up her look constantly. The tone of the chart is lighthearted,
which matches the tone of the subject matter. There aren't a lot of news
stories that are 1) this visual, 2) appropriate for a lighthearted tone
and 3) framed in a feature-y context such as this one.

We still had to approach the image sourcing and layout in a responsible,
appropriate way: obtaining images through our Getty subscription,
placing them in an appropriate context and making sure they display
properly on all devices.

Do the right thing. Cardi's watching.
