# africa-us-military-20180328

This is an update to [africa-us-military-20171019](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/tree/master/2017/10/africa-us-military-20171019), which initially ran in October 2017 with [Greg Myre's story](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/20/558757043/the-u-s-military-in-africa-a-discreet-presence-in-many-places).

Greg asked us to update it in March 2018 in anticipation of a report on
the Niger ambush. He had some tweaks to the language and wanted to
change Somalia to a single shade, removing the autonomous territory of
Somaliland.

After checking out the original graphic, I realized the Illustrator file
used to create the map was not synced to the assets server. I think it
was on our intern Matt Zhang's computer, which has since been wiped. So
I updated the Somalia colors in Photoshop, directly on the .png files.
(I know, I know.)

Including this info in case the same issue comes up again in the future!

I also changed the `ai2html-graphic.html` template so it accepts copy
from the spreadsheet through Jinja. *Note:* if you change any of the
HTML in that file, you should make sure to change it in both the desktop
and mobile version of the graphic.
