# Women in Prison soundscape portraits

This is **one of nine portraits** in a story about incarcerated women
that ran in October 2018. Since the portraits all share styles and
functionality, the CSS and JS actually point to the same CSS and JS
files for each graphic.

Each project also points to [the same spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3iX0HzLcBUOK-VRdL6d-cr5nBdm_AHYUqGtz37xHA4/edit#gid=0), for ease of editing.

**NOTE: This project folder does NOT include the CSS or JSS for the
project. Those can be found under** `women-prison-soundscape-20181012`.
