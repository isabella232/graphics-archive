This graphic accompanies a Sept. 10, 2018, story by Ayesha Rascoe: ['Low IQ,' 'SPECTACULAR,' 'Dog': How Trump Tweets About African-Americans](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=645594393)

Ayesha's analysis:

> NPR examined Trump's Twitter feed between and June 1 and Labor Day. It provided a snapshot of a president who directs venomous tirades at black public figures who bash him, while singling out black celebrities who support him for praise.
>
> During those three months, Trump tweeted almost 900 times about everything from tariffs to North Korea.
>
> Nearly 50 tweets were focused on a black person or black Americans in general, with 20 of those tweets negative in tone.
