# East Liverpool, Ohio, Portraits

This project involves a series of designed pullquotes and lazy-loaded images.

This is **one of nine portraits** in a story about opioids and East Liverpool,
Ohio, that ran in November 2018. Since the portraits all share styles and
functionality, the CSS and JS actually point to the same CSS and JS
files for each graphic.

Each project also points to [the same spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JDSCFixbAkOaHWuzRPp_pEP66G8iy50S2JjKuVmoFd8/edit#gid=1401251923), for ease of editing.

**NOTE: This project folder does NOT include the images, CSS or JSS for the
project. Those can be found under** `liverpool-ohio-20181115`.
