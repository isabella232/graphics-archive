# Korean Adoptees Portraits

This project involves a series of designed pullquotes and lazy-loaded images.

This is **one of ten portraits** in a story about Korean-American/Korean-Canadian
identity. Since the portraits all share styles and functionality, the CSS and JS
point to the same CSS and JS files for each graphic.

Each project also points to [the same spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wHSUOo86dqTu1AOR5_8ZpQO0IQPKHm9_nSPN0pE1Wrg/edit#gid=1401251923), for ease of editing.

**NOTE: This project folder does NOT include the images, CSS or JSS for the
project. Those can be found under** `korean-adoptees-20190305`.
