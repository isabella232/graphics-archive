# Soundscape portraits

This is **one of twelve portraits** in a story about life-size cutouts and grief that ran in NPR's "The Picture Show" blog. Since the portraits all share styles and functionality, the CSS and JS actually point to the same CSS and JS files for each graphic.

Each project also points to [the same spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jewDpnsAQ9oh73U3sGMDrUQb5v3SBLT2kpLrRZve-wc/edit#gid=0), for ease of editing.

**NOTE: This project folder does NOT include the images, audio, CSS or JSS for the
project. Those can be found under** `soundscape-cutout-20181121`.
