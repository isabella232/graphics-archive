# Civility Portraits

This project involves a series of designed pullquotes and lazy-loaded images.

This is **one of five embeds** in a story about civility. Since the portraits
all share styles and functionality, the CSS and JS
point to the same CSS and JS files for each graphic.

Each project also points to [the same spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J3lkcuhiKCGyETZ0HAH7G_hxg9w1H0aRbnBbI7SrFJ8/edit#gid=1401251923), for ease of editing.

**NOTE: This project folder does NOT include the images, CSS or JSS for the
project. Those can be found under** `civility-20190409`.
