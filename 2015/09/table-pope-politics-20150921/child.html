                            Democrats remain the party of abortion rights. The Catholic Church, meanwhile, is still staunchly opposed to abortion. However, his (slight) softening of the church's stance takes the temperature of the debate over this issue down a notch.

                            The pope and the church are still firmly opposed to same-sex marriage, and that clashes with Democrats. But Francisâ€™ statement here was taken as an indication of some potential openness to civil unions. The GOP platform, meanwhile, continues to stand firmly against any moderation on marriage.

                            The pope has called on governments to take greater steps on climate change and not to let short-term economic growth cloud their judgment. The GOP platform calls for conservation but emphasizes the role of the private sector and citizens while "reining in the EPA."

But the pope did not go so far as to endorse artificial contraception to limit childbearing â€“ despite about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds/2014/02/08/e90ecef4-8f89-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html">4 in 5 Catholics worldwide</a> supporting its use.

                            While some Republicans have been in favor of immigration reform, the GOP has also recently been on the side of more restrictions. Some more extreme party members like Iowa Rep. Steve King and Donald Trump have also spread (<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798">unfounded</a>) fears about immigrants as dangerous.

                            The church's stance on defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman is unlikely to change anytime soon. It lines up with the GOP's definition and runs counter to the Democratic Partyâ€™s position. However, some see the pope's comments as moving away from traditional rhetoric on gays and lesbians and indicative of a shifting tone of the church.
