        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>
            1. Clinton voted for border fence legisltion in 2006 but in 2008 clarified her stance, saying that "there may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate."</br>
            2. In this chart, candidates who support a path to citizenship automatically get a "yes" for supporting a path to legal status, since citizenship <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2014/0131/Immigration-reform-101-How-is-legal-status-different-from-citizenship">goes above and beyond legal status</a>.</br>
            3. On all answers marked "Unclear," NPR reached out to campaigns to clarify their stances, unless otherwise footnoted.</br>
            4. Source: Email from campaign</br>
            5. In an email to NPR, the O'Malley campaign said, "E-Verify cannot happen in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform."</br>
            6. Sanders in 2013 voted for an immigration bill that (among many other things) mandated E-Verify, but his position is otherwise unclear.</br>
            7. Christie said in May that he thought a path to citizenship <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/19/chris-christie-path-citizenship-extreme-way-go/">was extreme</a>, but in July he stood by past comments supporting a path to citizenship.</br>
            8. Cruz has said he wants a "robust E-Verify system," but has been less clear on whether he wants it to be mandatory.</br>
            9. Fiorina's comments have indicated that she might be philosophically in favor of ending birthright citizenship, but she is also opposed to ending it because it would be politically difficult.</br>
            10. Fiorina has said E-Verify can't be mandatory because it doesn't work properly.</br>
            11. Huckabee has said he is in favor of a path for "DREAMers" and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201237_pf.html">years ago</a> said he was in favor of a pathway to citizenship for a broader population of unauthorized immigrants. He has seemed to distance himself lately, saying he opposes "amnesty."</br>
            12. Though he has been <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/politics/bobby-jindal-illegal-immigrants-11-million/">less clear</a> on it recently and has also said he opposes "amnesty," Jindal in a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/352983/botching-immigration-again-gov-bobby-jindal">2013 op-ed</a> said he supported a path to legal status and eventually citizenship "once the border is secure."</br>
            13. Kasich says he'd be open to a path to citizenship as a part of a broader immigration reform deal.</br>
            14. In an early 2013 speech, Paul seemed to back a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, though he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/03/19/rand-paul-advisers-say-he-didnt-back-faster-path-to-citizenship/">later insisted</a> that was not what he was doing. A few months later, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/06/20/rand-paul-seeks-to-strip-path-to-citizenship/">moved to strip</a> a pathway to citizenship out of an immigration reform bill.</br>
            15. Rubio has said he could support a path to citizenship but that it should be <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/marco-rubio-opposes-path-to-citizenship.html">"10 or 12 years"</a> (that is, after his hypothetical presidency) until that discussion happens, as New York Magazine writes.</br>
            16. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T77sLD1pei4">Oct. 29 interview</a>, Rubio said he wouldn't "immediately revoke" Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and that he hoped it would only end as a result of immigration reform. But days later, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/marco-rubio-daca-must-end-or-without-immigration-reform-n457496">he said</a> he would revoke DACA. In addition, he has said he would revoke Deferred Action for Parents of Americans..</br>
            17. Trump wants to deport unauthorized immigrants, then allow some back in.</br>
