    <h1>Congress&rsquo; Big Fiscal Deadlines, Explained</h1>
    <h2>Lawmakers have two huge looming deadlines coming up: The U.S. is about to (once again) hit the debt ceiling, and (once again) the government will soon have to pass a new appropriations bill or face a shutdown. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about both.</h2>

Republicans are asking for changes in entitlement payments, and they have raised other issues, such as funding for Planned Parenthood. The two sides have also differed over whether and how to lift sequestration caps on defense and discretionary spending. It has been a stalemate so far.</div>

<li><strong>Social Security and Medicare recipients.</strong> The U.S. makes tens of millions of payments a month on programs like Social Security, veterans' benefits, and many others. Lew has warned that without raising the debt ceiling, the government couldn't keep paying those bills.</li>
<li><strong>Bondholders.</strong> If the Treasury runs out of cash, it may not be able to pay public investors, including U.S. pension funds and retirees, as well as foreign governments.</li>
<li><strong>Stockholders.</strong> Stock investors could lose money if a Treasury default rattles financial markets. Stocks took a big hit in August 2011, when a bruising debt ceiling battle led to a U.S. credit downgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Homebuyers and other borrowers.</strong> If Treasury defaults even briefly, the result could be a lower credit rating. A lower rating typically means higher interest rates — and many consumer loan rates are pegged to Treasury rates.</li>
<li><strong>Taxpayers.</strong> If Treasury ends up having to pay higher interest rates, then servicing the U.S. debt would become even more expensive. One way or another, taxpayers must make good on existing debt, and it’s easier to do that when Treasury can offer low interest rates.</li>
</ul></div>
                    <div class="budget"><ul>
<li><strong>Small businesses.</strong> During a shutdown, government agencies that help businesses, such as the Small Business Administration and the Federal Housing Administration, can’t process loans for construction and other purposes. During the 2013 shutdown, the Defense Department said its small-business spending dropped by 40 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism.</strong> National parks and the Smithsonian would shut down. During the last shutdown, about $500 million in visitor spending was lost.</li>
<li><strong>Medical products and drugs.</strong> In a shutdown, the Food and Drug Administration can’t approve medical products, devices and drugs. The National Institutes of Health must stop much of its research.</li>
<li><strong>Federal employees.</strong> They do not get paid during the shutdown and cannot do their work, such as processing tax refunds, preparing for flu season, inspecting food and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Job seekers.</strong> The 2013 government shutdown killed the creation of an estimated 120,000 jobs, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</li>

                            As Treasury secretary, Lew is one of the key people sounding the alarm on the debt ceiling. He has been warning Congress for weeks now that not raising the ceiling could be catastrophic. Should the U.S. hit the ceiling, it's not certain what would happen next. Treasury might then have to decide which bills to prioritize.

                            The outgoing speaker is reportedly close to reaching a deal with fellow congressional leaders on a debt ceiling hike <em>and</em> a two-year budget deal. Reaching a deal on either issue could create political fallout for Paul Ryan, who will almost certainly be the next speaker, but it would also relieve Ryan of dealing with two huge immediate problems.

                            If Boehner reaches a debt ceiling or budget deal, conservative members might force a Speaker Ryan to take a stand on whether he would have done the same, especially if Boehner is forced to pass it with Democrats' votes. If Boehner does not reach a deal, Ryan will have to wangle votes in a divided GOP caucus. Conservative members may punish him for cutting a deal with or relying too heavily on votes from Democrats.
