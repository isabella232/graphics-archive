                        <h4>About William Carlos Williams' 'Summer Song'</h4>
                        <h6>by David Orr</h6>
                        <p>William Carlos Williams (1883-1963) is one of the most celebrated American poets of the 20th century.  As a young man, Williams was briefly associated with Ezra Pound’s spare, subject-fixated “Imagism” movement, but Williams soon developed a voice too singular to fit neatly into any group identity.  That voice -- quirky, unpretentious, ranging easily between joy and darkness -- reflected Williams’ fascination with life in and around Rutherford, New Jersey, where he spent his career as a general-practice doctor. </p>
                        <p>Williams is widely admired (and occasionally reviled) for his distinctive free-verse technique, which emphasizes line breaks, isolated words and subtle shifts in syntax.  His description of a woman eating plums in “To a Poor Old Woman” is a representative example of his ability to say very different things with small gestures, in this case without even changing words:</p>
                        <p>
                        <em>They taste good to her<br>
                        They taste good  <br>
                        to her. They taste<br>
                        good to her<br></em>
                        </p>
                        <p>“Summer Song” is taken from Williams’ third book, <em>Al Que Quiere!</em>, and strikes a whimsically serious note that is characteristic.  The moon is one of the oldest props in poetry, whether it appears as a symbol of constancy, inconstancy, companionship, alienation or (in Plath’s “The Moon and the Yew Tree”) obliterating despair.  But Williams’ summer moon is unusual:  a traveler with a “faintly ironical smile,” a “sleepily indifferent / smile.”  The poet doesn’t simply look at the moon, he <em>becomes</em> the moon by assuming its costume: “a shirt / your color” and a “necktie / sky-blue.”  The poem’s closing question -- “where would they carry me?” -- is as amused and ironic as the moon itself, because while the moon wanders, it always returns to the same familiar places.  It is, like Williams, a world traveler who never leaves home.  </p>
