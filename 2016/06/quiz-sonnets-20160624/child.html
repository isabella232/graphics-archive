                <p>This is the same harsh angle of the sun,<br/ >
this is the same so deadly humid heat<br/ >
I felt that week your ending had begun,<br />
reflecting from the glass along the street,<br />
the shattered bits of accidents or trash,<br />
the careless cost of greed obsessed with speed,<br />
the same damned world that made your system crash<br />
and sprout that cancer like a roadside weed.<br />
I walked those mornings to the hospital,<br />
eyes downcast, sweating, breathing in the fumes<br />
of fast Columbus traffic, senses dull,<br />
or so I thought, but now this heat exhumes<br />
the body of that grief.  I saw, I heard,<br />
and I remember, Mother.  Every word</p>

                <p>The dirty rusty wooden dresser drawer.<br />
A couple million people wearing drawers,<br />
Or looking through a lonely oven door,<br />
Flowers covered under marble floors.<br />
<br />
And lying sleeping on an open bed.<br />
And I remember having started tripping,<br />
Or any angel hanging overhead,<br />
Without another cup of coffee dripping.<br />
<br />
Surrounded by a pretty little sergeant,<br />
Another morning at an early crawl.<br />
And from the other side of my apartment,<br />
An empty room behind the inner wall.<br />
<br />
A thousand pictures on the kitchen floor,<br />
Talked about a hundred years or more.</p>

                <p>A green nub pushes up from moist, dark soil.<br />
Three weeks without stirring, now without strife<br />
From the unknown depths of a thumbpot life<br />
In patient rhythm slides forth without turmoil,<br />
A tiny green thing poking through its sheath.<br />
Shall I see the world? Yes, it is bright.<br />
Silent and slow it stretches for the light<br />
And opens, uncurling, above and beneath.<br />
The sun warms it and with a little time<br />
Another slight leaf joins its neighbor,<br />
They crown slowly and birth without labor<br />
Feeding on the air&#8217;s breath like a rhyme.<br />
How can we know with body and with brain,<br />
The force that makes the earth suck up the rain.</p>

And following this dress-rehearsal pain<br />
Gives way to Joy, mistress of ardor, art,<br />
And love, who sure this mess would straighten out?<br />
<br />
For Joy has no illusions of a break;<br />
She brooks many ill fusions of extremes,<br />
And shares her light &#8216;till few suns could compete;<br />
Her binding love makes twos ones and keeps peace.<br />
<br />
So best not make a strumpet of this Joy,<br />
Assert that she pays some debt with her smile,<br />
Or name to her a numb set of stale sparks;<br />
She never has succumbed yet, bless her heart.<br />
<br />
Her love is full and indiscriminate<br />
And even so you&#8217;ll find no sin in it.</p>

hand clasped in her breast her withered hands fling<br />
yet by and claim loves boon nor let the tame<br />
But this affliction sure thy heart inflame<br />
he in silence come and assistance bring<br />
then comes a small bright spark comes wandering<br />
sorrows for him you gave that love once came.<br />
<br />
Of doom lest any see the signal hear<br />
that tremble through their incandescent nights<br />
wave must dare if the while himself he cheers<br />
what sudden bird will bring us any cheer<br />
Fled to that audit by advised respects<br />
a sequent day to your world of gain roars.</p>

                <p>Living by trust, the gardener plants the seed,<br />
puts it away beyond her power of sight.<br />
She trusts the universe to share her need<br />
to rise through quiet darkness to the light,<br />
to birth the hidden germ that&#8217;s deep within,<br />
unfurl green life already formed inside<br />
and nurture it until it can begin<br />
to feed itself upon old life that&#8217;s died.<br />
It helps that she has learned some good techniques,<br />
some tricks to save from bug and blight and rust,<br />
some ways to make fertility increase&#8212;<br />
but most of all, it helps she&#8217;s learned to trust.<br />
She knows the force of sprout and womb and nest<br />
that works when we let go control and rest.</p>
