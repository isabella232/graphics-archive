            <h1>Black Representation In Congress</h1>
            <h2>The number of African-American representatives in Congress has increased. However, when compared to the African-American population size, representation is still lagging. <p>In 1977, African-Americans only made up 18 of Congress&#8217; 535 members, or around 3.3 percent, though they made up 11.5 percent of the population &mdash; which would equal around 61 of 535 members. Today, there are 48 African-American members of Congress, or around 9 percent, while African-Americans make up 13.2 percent of the population. A proportional share of Congress members would be 71 out of 535.</p></h2>
