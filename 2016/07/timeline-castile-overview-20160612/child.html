        <h1>Cycles Of Traffic Stops, Fines And Suspensions</h1>
        <h2>Between July 2002 and his death in July 2016, Philando Castile was stopped by police at least 46 times. Some traffic stops kicked off months- and years-long spirals of fines, driver&#8217;s license suspensions and more traffic stops that Castile would eventually pay off or settle in court. He was most often cited for driving on a suspended license or lacking proof of&nbsp;insurance.</h2>
